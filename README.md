# Vernam Cypher
A Python compiled executable that can encode and decode vernam cyphers with different formats.

Features included:
- Loading and saving to a text file
- Generating keys with varying strength
- Robust systems that can prevent loss of cached data
- Being able to wrap a key to the length of your input

Most security solution will dislike the executable as it is not signed. If you don't want to trust it then use the raw Python file (installation of Python required).
